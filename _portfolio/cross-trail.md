## About Portfolio Review
At the University of Minnesota, product design students must pass a portfolio review to progress past first-year courses. This includes a design challenge with a prompt. Students must research, ideate, sketch, render (in marker), and model a product in about two weeks based on the prompt.
### Prompt
The class of 2027's prompt was an "innovative first aid kit" for a target user of the student's choice. They could pick between construction workers/industrial professionals, campers/hikers, and daycare/school staff.
 
I chose to cater mainly toward campers and hikers.
